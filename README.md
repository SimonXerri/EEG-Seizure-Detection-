# EEG-Seizure-Detection
Researched and developed a seizure detection system using MATLAB and Python and investigated the effects of using classifier stacking for model accuracy enhancements. 
Several machine learning and signal processing techniques were explored to produce the best performing models.  
Achieved model Sensitivity of 95%, Specificity of 97%, and Accuracy of 96%.
